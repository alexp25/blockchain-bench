## Notes
The performance information is obtained by measuring the transaction throughput for different types of smart contract transactions. The term “transaction” is used in a generic sense, and refers to any interaction with a smart contract, regardless of the complexity of the subsequent interaction(s) with the blockchain platform.

Measuring transaction throughput demonstrates potential transaction rates, and the impact of the relative cost of different Hyperledger Fabric Stub API calls.

The data contained in the reports was measured in a controlled environment, results obtained in other environments might vary. For more details on the environments used, see the resources at the end of this report.

The performance data cannot be compared across versions of Hyperledger Fabric, as testing hardware and environments may have changed significantly. The testing contents and processing methodologies may have also changed between performance reports, and so cannot be compared.
